Possibly it would be better if \"New node\" was a label to the left of the table? Then if these were just inputs rather than an edit-in-place thing, we could use placeholder to repeat the column heading in the inputs (Host and Alias).\r\n\r\n@martinpolley wrote:\r\n\r\nRe: The table of nodes and adding a new node (same for other such tables).\r\n\r\nI tried adding a \"New node\" label to the left of the \"new node\" table, but it didn't look very good.\r\n\r\n![new_node_label](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/432817/1974018/ddcf7572-8366-11e3-9647-c1e335a86ee9.png)\r\n\r\nWhat I think would work better is this: Just have *one* table where the bottom row is just inputs (and the tag control). Then when the node is added, it is changed into an \"editable\" row and a new (empty) \"new node\" row is added below it.\r\n\r\nThe inputs should have placeholders. We should also try to make sure that it's easy to add multiple nodes via keyboard only (type, tab, type, tab, type, tab, enter, repeat). \r\n\r\nI think I understand now why this is confusing. When you hit \"+\", the node gets added to the table, which feels kind of permanent, as though it has been saved somewhere. But to *actually* save it, you need to click Save.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of this idea? Instead of adding rows to a \"saved-looking\" table, we just have regular input fields (whether in a table, or arranged like the other form stuff on the Bootstrap grid). We would still have a button for adding another row, but when you add a row, the state of the existing row **does not change**. \r\n\r\nLike this:\r\n\r\nInitial view:\r\n\r\n![nodes1](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/432817/1982323/0ddcac70-83f9-11e3-8e4c-049cc7974704.jpg)\r\n\r\nOne node added:\r\n\r\n![nodes2](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/432817/1982325/1d5b2aaa-83f9-11e3-9e1c-0f4ca1121433.jpg)\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\n@zivry wrote (about nodes list):\r\nbtw, this is really huge for normal projects, I think it should be in\r\nanother page or something.","closed_by":null}
