	- [x] ~~configure project node and email, add new item should be static and not editable~~\r\n- 
	[x] ~~\"Enter new Node\" is the same in both columns. Possibly it would be better if \"New node\" was a label to the left of the table? Then if these were just inputs rather than an edit-in-place thing, we could use placeholder to repeat the column heading in the inputs (Host and Alias).~~ moved to issue #89 \r\n- 
	[x] ~~In \"Nodes\" view, the list of nodes under each version does not seem to be in any logical order. Maybe sorting them alphabetically by default would be a good idea?~~ in issue #65 - sorting them by count.\r\n- 
	[x] ~~In Tags and Command History sections on the left of the page, the help icon doesn't line up with the text. (Though in other places it is fine.) Overriding the vertical-align: text-top that Bootstrap gives it with vertical-align: text-bottom just for these ones looks like it should fix it.~~\r\n- 
	[x] ~~In the graphs, it looks kinda funny that the line rises vertically from zero for the first data point. Is there anything we can do about this?~~\r\n- [ ] ~~In the \"Status\" view, the default sorting (by number of nodes) is sensible. Would adding an option to sort alphabetically/numerically be useful too?~~\r\n- [ ] ~~In the home page, do you think it would add value to give some health status indication for each project? So you can see if there are any problems without having to drill down into each project. Maybe a green and/or red bar like in Status view (but combined for all nodes in each project)?~~ moved to issue #88 \r\n- [ ] When I switch to Nodes view, \"Run Command\" is visible while the page is loading. (Also \"Select all\".) Then it disappears (because I don't have permissions). Is there a way to make it not appear at all?\r\n- 
	[x] ~~Also (Command History again), I think it would work better if the time and date were split from the name of the command and aligned to the right. It would make it more obvious that they aren't part of the name. (To me, at least, it wasn't obvious that there was a timestamp when I first looked at it.)~~\r\n- 
	[x] ~~When you click on an item in Command History, it's not obvious which item you are looking at. The breadcrumb only shows the name of the command, but not the date/time. Maybe this could be added? Also maybe highlight the selected item in the command history?~~\r\n- [ ] In the search results page (when you search for a project), the breadcrumb nav doesn't change. Maybe it should? I'm not sure about this, because it's like when you click on a tab (like nb_dev)â€”you get a subset of all projects, and the breadcrumb doesn't change there either. So maybe it's OK ï??.\r\n- 
	[X] ~~The tooltips in the panels on the left inherit the font (all caps, small, grey) from the title of the panel (Menu, Command Executor Status, etc.), which makes them inconsistent with the other tooltips.~~\r\n- [ ] When you delete a project, you get a Javascript alert dialog box, not a Bootstrap one. Which looks a bit odd to me.\r\n- [ ] The fact that \"Codeine Logs\" takes you out of the app completely feels weird. Just sayingâ€¦\r\n\r\n",
